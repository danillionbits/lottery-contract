# Lottery Smart Contract
The Lottery smart contract demonstrates the power of blockchain by providing a decentralized platform for organizing lotteries. It brings transparency and fairness to the process, eliminating the need for intermediaries.

## Components
### Prize Pool and Eligible Players
The smart contract features a prize pool where participants contribute funds. Individuals become eligible players by sending a specific amount of cryptocurrency to the contract.

### Winner Selection
The contract manager, usually the contract creator, has the authority to initiate the winner selection process. This process is designed to be fair and unbiased.

### Round Reset
Once a winner is chosen and the prize is awarded, the contract resets itself for the next round. This ensures that the lottery remains continuous and accessible to new participants.

## Usage
1. **Participants Join:** Individuals interested in participating in the lottery send a specified amount of cryptocurrency to the contract.

2. **Manager's Role:** The contract manager is responsible for triggering the winner selection process. This step ensures that only authorized individuals can determine the winner.

3. **Winner Selection:** The contract uses a method to randomly select a winner from the list of eligible players. This random selection adds an element of unpredictability and fairness.

4. **Prize Award:** The selected winner is awarded the entire prize pool. This step is executed transparently on the blockchain, ensuring accuracy and accountability.

5. **Round Reset:** After awarding the prize, the contract resets itself, preparing for the next round of participation.
